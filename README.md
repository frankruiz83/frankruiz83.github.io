Welcome to my digital portfolio! It may be a bit sparse for now, but soon this will be populated with my school projects, reports, and other things that will allow you, the user, to both marvel at my digital creations and scoff at their flaws. I hope you enjoy your time here, and if you have any questions, feel free to hit me up at:
